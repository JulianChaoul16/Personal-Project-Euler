# Personal-Project-Euler








This Repository is meant to keep track of my Personal Project Euler solutions and attempts. Each solution is programmed in C++, only library used is STL. I will only post the solutions up to 100 as Project Euler specifically asks that no one post solutions for any questions past 100. 


## Takeaways 
This challenge has taught me way more about math than coding (I guess that was the purpose to begin with). However, the neat part was trying to optimize the solutions with my background knowledge of DSA. Once I found out how to do the math, I would brute-force the answer before simplifying it by incorporating various data structures.
